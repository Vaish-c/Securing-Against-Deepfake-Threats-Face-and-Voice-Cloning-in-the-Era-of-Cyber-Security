The "TrimDataset" utilized for image detection is meticulously organized into three primary folders: Train, Test, 
and Validation. Each of these folders is further divided into subfolders containing real and fake images. The Train 
folder comprises 3000 real images and 3000 fake images. Similarly, the Test folder contains a more extensive 
collection with 9000 real images and 9000 fake images. The Validation folder, like the Train folder, includes 3000 
real images and 3000 fake images. This dataset is comprehensive and versatile, featuring a diverse array of 
individuals across all age groups—from infants to senior citizens—and encompassing both genders. The total 
number of images in this dataset is 30,000. The inclusion of such a broad spectrum of demographics in both the 
real and fake images enhances the robustness and generalizability of the detection model. 
Voice Dateset: 
The DEEP-VOICE: Real-time Detection of AI-Generated Speech for DeepFake Voice Conversion is provided in 
two formats:Raw Audio: Available in the "AUDIO" directory, divided into "REAL" and "FAKE" class directories. 
Audio filenames indicate the original speaker and the target voice, such as "Obama-to-Biden" for Barack Obama's 
speech converted to Joe Biden's voice.Extracted Features: Found in the "DATASET-balanced.csv" file, this data 
was used in the accompanying study. It includes features extracted from one-second audio windows, balanced 
through random sampling
