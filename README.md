In this project, the main goal is to create and implement a comprehensive multimedia processing system 
with three key features: 
Image detection, Voice detection, and Video framing. Each feature is designed to 
meet specific needs and uses advanced algorithms to provide accurate and efficient results. This system 
allows users to easily and accurately perform various multimedia processing tasks, gaining valuable insights 
from different multimedia data sources. 

Following frameworks, IDE's and Technologies can be used:
Microsoft Visual Studio Code, Python IDLE, Jupyter Notebook
